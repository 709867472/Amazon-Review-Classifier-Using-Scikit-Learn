# Amazon-Review-Classifier-Using-Scikit-Learn
We have 400K Amazon reviews and this is the csv file: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bDwcBdCiEZ2pfLOc6ANi85TLAspyhYUR. I just picked every 5th review as test data and the rest of them as traning data. First I use scikit-learn to get the feature matrix of our data, then use 3 methods including Decision Tree, Neural Network and Naive Bayes to predict a new review. I also uesed pyplot to plot some curves which shown the performance of these 3 methods.
